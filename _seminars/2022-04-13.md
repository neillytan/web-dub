title:      "Marginality and Technology: From Pregnancy Loss to Emotion Artificial Intelligence"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  My scholarship spans examinations of (1) (de)marginalizing social processes as mediated in
  sociotechnical systems such as social media platforms, (2) algorithms’ and designs’ roles in
  marginalization, and (3) the implications of algorithmic inferences and classifications of
  potentially marginalizing information. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of (2) and then
  discuss some work in (3).

  Taking pregnancy loss as a marginalized reproductive health experience, I first describe how
  pregnancy tracking and algorithmic encounters can cause harm to individuals experiencing
  pregnancy losses. I theorize these harms as symbolic annihilation through design and
  algorithmic symbolic annihilation – concepts I put forth as tools to interrogate how
  marginalization is embedded, enacted, and experienced in diverse sociotechnical contexts.
  
  I then take emotional and psychological states as another information type that, if made visible
  in some contexts, can be marginalizing. I will explore the implications of technologies that claim
  to algorithmically recognize, detect, predict, and infer emotions, emotional states, and mental
  health status — broadly referred to as emotion recognition / artificial intelligence (AI). I will share
  my recent mixed methods work examining: 1) data subjects’ attitudes toward and conceptions of
  emotion recognition/AI; and 2) the landscape of emotion recognition/AI technologies in the
  workplace, providing a view into a future of work with emotion AI and its implications. I suggest
  that increasing the visibility of emotional states has the potential to create additional emotional
  labor for workers, can compromise worker privacy, and contributes to a larger pattern of blurring
  boundaries between expectations of the workplace and a worker’s autonomy. I argue that
  emotion AI is not just technical, it is sociotechnical, political, and enacts/shifts power – it can
  contribute to marginalization despite claimed benefits. I advocate that we (and regulators) need
  to shift how technological inventions are evaluated.

  Note: This talk includes content about pregnancy loss in the first ~10 minutes and pointers to
  mental health conditions in the second part.

  [Dr. Nazanin Andalibi](https://www.nazaninandalibi.net/) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of
  Information. She is also affiliated with the Center for Social Media Responsibility, the Center for
  Ethics, Society, and Computing, and the Digital Studies Institute. Her research interests are in
  social computing and HCI. Specifically, she studies the interplay between marginality and
  technology. She examines how marginality is experienced, enacted, facilitated, or disrupted in
  and as mediated through sociotechnical systems.

  Andalibi's scholarship informs theory, design, activism, and policy for socio-technical futures that
  foreground marginalized individuals’ values and needs to support qualities such as wellbeing,
  privacy, ethics, and justice. Andalibi’s work is published in venues including CHI, CSCW,
  TOCHI, JMIR, and New Media and Society, and featured by media outlets such as CNN, Fast
  Company, and Huffington Post. Her publications have received Best Paper and Honorable
  Mention Awards at CHI and CSCW and her work is sponsored by the National Science
  Foundation and the Digital Studies Institute.
